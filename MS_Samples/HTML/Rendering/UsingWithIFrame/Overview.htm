    When&nbsp;a chart is rendered using using an IFrame, two&nbsp;web pages are 
	used: one page that contains and renders the chart and another page that makes 
	reference to the page that creates the chart.</p>
<p>
	The page that creates the chart is a simple ASPX page with a chart 
	control.&nbsp;There are no special rendering options set and code-behind may 
	still be used.&nbsp;This page may also contain other ASP.NET controls to 
	manipulate the chart.</p>
<p>
	The second page that makes reference can be any webpage, including HTML and ASP, 
    and contains 
	an&nbsp;IFrame tag with its SRC attribute set to the name of the first page. For 
    example, <b>&lt;IFrame src= 'UsingWithIFrame.aspx' ... &gt;</b>.</p>
<p>This sample&nbsp;contains two web forms:</p>
<p>#1 -&nbsp;UsingWithIFrame.aspx - contains the Chart control.<br />
    #2 -&nbsp;UsingWithIFrame.htm - contains the&nbsp;IFrame tag.</BODY>
