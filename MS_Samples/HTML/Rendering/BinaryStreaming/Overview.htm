        When&nbsp;a chart is rendered using binary streaming,&nbsp;two&nbsp;web pages are used: one 
        page that creates the Chart control and another that makes reference to the page 
        with the Chart control.
	</p>
	<p>The page that that creates the Chart control is a simple ASPX page, and the Chart 
    control&#39;s rendering method is set to <b>BinaryStreaming</b>.&nbsp;On this page, 
	all HTML tags are removed, leaving only the Chart definition in XML.&nbsp;You 
    can still use code-behind.</p>
	<p>The second page that makes reference contains 
	an&nbsp;Image element with its ImageUrl attribute set to the name of the first page. This rendering 
	method is fast because it does not require any disk space or security rights for 
    writing data 
	to the temporary image files.</p>
	<p>This sample is made of two web forms:&nbsp;</p>
<p>#1 -&nbsp;BinaryStreamingImage.aspx - contains the Chart control.<br />
    #2 -&nbsp;BinaryStreaming.aspx - contains the&nbsp;image tag.</p>
