			<p>The easiest way to render a chart is as a static image in one of several 
				standard formats.&nbsp;This is appropriate for&nbsp;most purposes. However, if 
				chart data changes frequently at the server, use 
				binary streaming to efficiently store images.</p>
			<p>When binary streaming is used, the chart image is sent directly to the client. 
					When the browser requests the image of the chart, it does this in the same manner as when it 
					requests a static image from the web server.&nbsp;This is&nbsp;particularly 
					useful when the chart image is frequently&nbsp;modified at run time or 
					when a web farm used.

                                When rendering a chart picture as an image,&nbsp;the chart picture is 
				automatically saved to a file. The <STRONG>ImageLocation</STRONG>
			property determines the absolute or relative location and name of this file (see the 
                figure below), 
			and the file extension is automatically added, depending on the image type 
			specified.
            <p>
                <IMG src="ImgLocation.PNG"></p>
            <p>
                By managing the location and name of the file using the  <STRONG>ImageLocation</STRONG>
				property, you can:&nbsp;
            <UL>
                <LI>Manage the maximum allowable number of image files that are generated.
                <LI>Insert a warning into the system event log if these temporary image files are overwritten within a specified 
                    length of time.
                <LI>Name files with a UID extension. </LI>
            </UL>
