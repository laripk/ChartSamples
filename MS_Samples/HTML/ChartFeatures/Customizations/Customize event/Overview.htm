	The Customize event is triggered when all chart data has been added and all chart 
	properties have been set.</p>
<p>The most important use of this event is the adjustment 
of automatically calculated property values (properties that have been set 
to "Auto"). For example, Minimum and Maximum properties 
	in the axis are set to "Auto" by default. Just before the chart is painted, the axis 
	automatically calculates the maximum and minimum scale values by examining 
	the series data.
</p>
<p>When the Customize event is triggered, all properties are already 
	calculated and stored as explicit values. If you make any changes to an element 
    in the chart area, you may need to recalculate the axis properties so that the 
    chart area is rendered correctly. To do this, use the RecalculateAxesScale method.
