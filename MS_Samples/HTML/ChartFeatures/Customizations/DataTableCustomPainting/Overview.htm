	This example uses a 
    System.Web.UI.Page method called AddDataTable to reserve some space on the 
ChartArea to allow for the painting. This is done by creating a row of custom 
    labels for each series attached to the chart area.</p>
<p>In the PostPaint event, a method called PaintDataTable is called to paint in 
the reserved chart area space. </p></html>
