			Serialization involves the saving of chart properties, usually to disk.&nbsp; 
			Deserialization&nbsp;involves&nbsp;the&nbsp;retrieval of&nbsp;serialized data, 
			followed by the&nbsp;loading of this data&nbsp;into the Chart control.</p>
		<p>Serialization enables you to persist and reuse a chart's appearance 
			properties and data. This can save you time when you regularly create charts 
            with the same appearance settings or from a specific data set.</p>
		<p>
                        Serialization&nbsp;is 
				accomplished using a ChartSerializer object. You can access it via the Chart.Serializer property.</p>

            Format of Serialized Data</h3>

                                The format of serialized data can be either XML or Binary. The advantage of XML 
					is that serialized data is readable, while the advantage of binary is that the 
					serialized data takes less storage space.</p>

                There are three methods by which chart data can be marked as serializable:</p>
            <OL>
                <LI>Without explicitly specifying any serializable properties. This causes all chart properties with non-default values (including chart data) 
                        to be serialized.</LI>
                <LI>Setting the Content property. This groups the chart properties to be serialized 
						into categories (data, appearance, and so on).</LI>
     </LI>
                <LI>Set the SerializableContent property, which is a comma-separated list of all 
						chart properties to be serialized.</LI>
            </OL>

                Non-serializable properties are set using the NonSerializableContent property. 
					This is a comma-separated listing of all chart properties not to be serialized, 
					and wildcards can be used in the string expression (in the same manner as the 
					SerializableContent property).</p>
