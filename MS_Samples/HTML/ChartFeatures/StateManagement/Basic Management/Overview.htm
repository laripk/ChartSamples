				In this example there is a delay in the routine for adding data to the chart

				time).<BR>

				When state management is enabled, all chart data is persisted in the 
        HTML content

	<H3>Benefits of State Management</H3>
	<BLOCKQUOTE dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
		<p>The greatest benefit of state management is in situations where a user accesses 
			a chart with a large amount of relatively static data that takes a long time to 
			retrieve. For example, if a chart is generated after a data query from a remote 
			database or socket server, then the chart's performance is affected by 
			factors external to your chart server, such as network delays, busy data server, 
			and so on.</p>
		<p>By using state management, the chart data and/or appearance settings are persisted and 
			reused for subsequent charts. This reduces the requests to the database or 
            socket server and improves the performance of your page.</p>
