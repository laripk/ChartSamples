			View state is used by the ASP.NET page framework to automatically save the page 
			and its control values prior to rendering the page, and state management is 
			accomplished using view state.</p>
		<p>When an ASP.NET page is processed the current state of the page and its controls 
			is converted into a string and saved in the page as a hidden field. When the 
			page is posted back to the server, such as through a postback event when a server-side 
			control is clicked, the page parses the view state string at page 
			initialization and restores property information in the page.</p>
		<p>For more information see the "Introduction to Web Forms State Management" topic 
			in your Visual Studio documentation.</p>
		<H3>Advantages of State Management</H3>
		<BLOCKQUOTE dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
			<p>The greatest benefit of state management is in situations where a user accesses 
			a chart with a large amount of relatively static data that takes a long time to 
			retrieve. For example, if a chart is generated after a data query from a remote 
			database or socket server, then the chart's performance is affected by 
			factors external to your chart server, such as network delays, busy data server, 
			and so on.</p>
			<p>By using state management, the chart data and/or appearance settings are persisted and 
			reused for subsequent charts. This reduces the requests to the database or 
            socket server and improves the performance of your page.</p>

		<H3>Considerations</H3>
		<BLOCKQUOTE dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
			<p>When using state management, you should consider the increase in the amount of data 
				sent from the server to the client. Using state management on appearance 
                settings causes a relatively small increase in network traffic, while using 
                state management on 1,000 data points causes a large increate in network 
                traffic.</p>
