                        The coordinate system of the Chart control is <i>relative</i>.&nbsp;Using relative 
			coordinates ensures that chart objects remain relative to 
			one another&nbsp;when the chart is resized, making positioning 
			and sizing easier.</p>
		<p>The&nbsp;coordinate system has its origin in the upper-left corner with the X 
			axis pointing to the right and the Y axis pointing down (see the figure below).&nbsp;For 
            3D charts the direction of the Z axis is outward (going out of the page).</p>
		<IMG src="../../Images/CoordinateSystem.bmp" border="0">
		<p>Coordinates are always expressed as a percentage of the&nbsp;element they are 
			being applied to.</p>
		<p>The coordinate system is applied to two types of objects:</p>
		<OL>
			<LI>
			Entire chart&nbsp;picture.<LI>
				All chart areas.</LI></OL>
		<H3>Chart Picture</H3>
		<BLOCKQUOTE dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
			<p>Coordinate values are measured as a percentage of the chart picture's width and 
				height.&nbsp;The top-left corner has the coordinates (0,0), and the 
				bottom-right corner has the coordinates (100,100).</p>
			<p>The chart picture&#39;s coordinate system determines the position of chart area 
				objects and&nbsp;legend objects (if the legends are not displayed within a chart area).</p>

		<H3>Chart Areas</H3>
