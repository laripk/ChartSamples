            To use Chart Control for .NET Framework, you must create a Web Application 
            project. When using code-behind, choose either C# or Visual Basic as the 
            language.</p>
		<H4>Adding the Chart Control to Your Form</H4>
		<p>Once you create a Web Application project, add a chart to a Web Form by dragging 
            a Chart control from the <b>Toolbox window </b>to the design surface. The figure below 
            shows the Chart control in the <b>Toolbox window</b>.</p>

			<H4>Setting Chart Properties</H4>
		<p>The Chart control makes all of its data and appearance properties available in 
            the <b>Properties window</b> in Visual Studio. Click on the Chart control in the design 
            surface to see the chart properties and customize them. If one of the properties 
            is a collection, you will see a <b>...</b> button to the right of its value 
            cell. You can click on the button to edit the items in the collection in the 
            <b>Collection Editor window</b>. The figure below shows the <b>Collection Editor window
            </b>for the Chart.ChartAreas collection property.</p>
