			Simple data binding of 
a&nbsp;table to a chart can be accomplished using the Chart.DataBindTable 
 method.</p>
		<p>Series are&nbsp;automatically created and added to the chart&nbsp;based on the 
			number of columns in the data source (one series per column of data). Each column entry&nbsp;results in the creation of a data point in that column's 
			corresponding series, and is used for the first Y value of the 
			point.&nbsp;To specify a column for the X 
			values,&nbsp;use the overloaded method definition that includes an&nbsp;<EM>xField</EM>
			parameter.</p>
		<p>This method traverses through the data source only once to bind all data.</p>
