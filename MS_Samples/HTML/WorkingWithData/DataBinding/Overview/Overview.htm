		<BLOCKQUOTE dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
			<p>Data binding can be accomplished at design-time using the Data Source 
                    Configuration Wizard. To use the Data Source Configuration, open the Chart 
                    control&#39;s smart tag, and then select <b>&lt;New data source...&gt;</b> in the 
                    drop-down list (see the figure below).</p>

            <p align="left">Alternatively, you can also double-click the Chart control and click 
                    the value cell of the DataSourceID property to open the Data Source 
                    Configuration Wizard.</p>

				There are a wide variety of data binding methods that can be used at run-time, 
				ranging from simple to more complex and powerful methods. Run-time data binding gives 
                you significant freedom and flexibility over how the data is bound.</p>
			<p>Binding from multiple data sources is supported. For example, a series X value can 
				be bound to an&nbsp;array of strings, and&nbsp;Y values can be bound to&nbsp;a 
				DataReader.</p>
			<p>The following decision tree can be used as a guideline when 
				deciding how to bind the data:</p>
