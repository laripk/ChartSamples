            The Y values of a data series can be bound to data sources using the&nbsp;DataBindY 
            method.</p>
        <p>
            The DataBindY method supports binding to multiple Y values. This is especially 
            useful when working with chart types that use multiple Y values such as the 
            Bubble chart and Stock chart.</p>
        <p>
            Some data sources support multiple values, such as an Excel worksheet that 
            contains multiple columns of data.&nbsp;If a column is not specified, then the first 
            available column will be used. To use a column other than the first, specify the 
            column name in the method call.</p>
