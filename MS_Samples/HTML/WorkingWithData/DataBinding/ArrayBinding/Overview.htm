		The X and Y values of a data 
series can be bound to arrays of values using 
the&nbsp;DataBindXY method.</p>
<p>The DataBindXY method supports multiple data sources for the X and 
		Y values, as well as binding to multiple Y values. This is especially 
		useful when working with chart types that use multiple Y values such as the 
    Bubble chart and Stock chart.</p>
