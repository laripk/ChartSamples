<p><br>Chart.DataBindCrossTable is different compared to all 
other binding methods in that it allows for the grouping of unique values in a 
column. Each unique value in the specified grouped column results in the creation of 
a data series.</p>
<p>Note that the method traverses through the specified data source only once to perform all 
binding. In addition, extended data point properties other than X and Y values 
can be bound.</p>
