			The X and Y values of a data 
series can be bound to data sources using 
the&nbsp;DataBindXY method.</p>
		<p>The DataBindXY method supports multiple data sources for the X and 
		Y values, as well as binding to multiple Y values. This is especially 
		useful when working with chart types that use multiple Y values such as the 
    Bubble chart and Stock chart.</p>
		<p>Some data sources support multiple values, such as an Excel worksheet that 
            contains multiple columns 
			of data.&nbsp;If a column is not specified, then the first available column 
			will be used. To use a column other than the first, specify the column name in 
			the method call.</p>
