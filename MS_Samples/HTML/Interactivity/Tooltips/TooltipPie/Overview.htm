	Standard tooltips are implemented by the Chart control using two properties:
</P>
<OL>
	<LI>
		ToolTip: allows for both design-time and run-time tooltips for 
		DataPoint, Series and LegendItem objects. Special 
		formatting can be used for these tooltips.
	</LI>
	<LI>
		LegendToolTip: used to set or get the tooltips of 
		default legend items created for DataPoint or Series objects, depending on the 
		chart type displayed. Special formatting can also be used for these tooltips.
	</LI>
</OL>
<P>Custom tooltips are implemented via the GetToolTipText event, which can be 
	used to display a tooltip for a chart element that doesn&#39;t have a tooltip 
    property and also to override the tooltip for a chart element that does 
	have a tooltip property.</P>
