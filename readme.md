# ChartSamples

Figuring out the Microsoft Chart control for Asp.Net.

The `MS_Samples` folder contains the `ASP.Net Samples Environment for Microsoft Chart Controls` downloaded from [here](https://code.msdn.microsoft.com/ASPNET-Samples-Environment-090f1268). 

The `commentary` folder contains my commentary on using the Chart control.
